**Control Theory Script**

**[Introduction]**

HOST: "Welcome to our video on Control Theory in FTC robotics! Today, we're diving deep into the key concepts that help our robots achieve precision and accuracy in movement. These concepts are at the core of how we get our robots to perform reliably and smoothly in any environment. Let’s get started!"

**[Scene 1: Understanding PID Control]**

HOST: "First up, let’s talk about one of the most fundamental control systems used in robotics: the PID Controller. PID stands for Proportional, Integral, and Derivative. Don’t worry, I’ll break it down.

The **Proportional** part looks at the current error between where the robot is and where it should be. The bigger the error, the bigger the correction. So, if the robot is way off, it makes a strong adjustment.

Then we have the **Integral** part, which focuses on past errors. This part makes sure the robot doesn’t get stuck in a steady state of error. It looks at all the previous mistakes and tries to eliminate them, making adjustments over time.

And finally, the **Derivative** part, which is all about prediction. It looks at how fast the error is changing, and helps the robot avoid overshooting its target, preventing wobbles or jerky movements.

When we fine-tune all three of these elements, we get smoother and more accurate movements, and that's exactly what we want for our robots."

**[Scene 2: RAMSETE Controller]**

HOST: "Next, let’s talk about the RAMSETE controller. This one's a bit different from PID. While PID is great for making corrections in straight-line movement, RAMSETE is perfect for following paths, especially when those paths aren’t just straight lines.

RAMSETE continuously adjusts the robot's speed and rotation to follow a pre-planned trajectory. Whether it’s turning around corners or navigating a curved path, RAMSETE helps keep everything smooth and on track. This is super useful during autonomous routines in FTC, where your robot has to follow complex paths and hit precise locations, all without human input."

**[Scene 3: Kalman Filter for Sensor Fusion]**

HOST: "Now, let’s talk about something that makes a huge difference in how precise our robots are: the **Kalman Filter**. In simple terms, the Kalman Filter is an algorithm that helps improve the accuracy of sensor data.

Imagine you're using multiple sensors on your robot, like encoders, IMUs, or even GPS. Sometimes, the data from these sensors can be noisy, right? The Kalman Filter takes this noisy data and merges it to give a much more reliable, accurate reading.

It’s particularly helpful when the robot needs to figure out exactly where it is on the field or correct its path. With the Kalman Filter, even in unpredictable environments, your robot can make precise movements based on cleaner, more reliable data."

**Odometry Script**

**[Introduction]**

HOST: "Now, let’s dive into another key aspect of robotics: **Odometry**. Odometry is how a robot tracks its position and movement on the field, which is critical for autonomous navigation. In this video, we’ll explore a few different techniques and how they help our robots move accurately."

**[Scene 1: Pedro Pathing]**

HOST: "One advanced technique is **Pedro Pathing**, which uses Bézier curves for smooth, fluid movement. Unlike rigid, predefined paths, Bézier curves allow the robot to adjust its trajectory on the fly, creating a much smoother path as it moves.

Bézier curves give us more control over the robot’s movement, reducing jerky or sharp turns. This makes the robot more adaptable to changes in the environment, and it’s especially useful during FTC matches, where things can get chaotic."

**[Scene 2: Road Runner 0.5 vs. 1.0]**

HOST: "Next up is **Road Runner**, a powerful motion-planning library used in FTC. Road Runner 0.5 was great, but **Road Runner 1.0** made some huge improvements. 

With the new version, we get features like **tick-based tuning**, which makes motion profiles even more precise, and the integration of **RAMSETE**, which helps our robot follow paths more accurately and smoothly.

Together, these improvements mean we get smoother trajectories and more efficient movement, making our robot even more capable during autonomous routines."

**RRT* Path Planning Script**

**[Introduction]**

HOST: "Now, let’s switch gears and talk about **RRT* Path Planning**. This algorithm is a game-changer when it comes to navigating through environments with obstacles. It’s especially helpful in dynamic environments like the FTC field, where things are constantly changing."

**[Scene 1: What is RRT*?]**

HOST: "RRT* stands for **Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star**, and it’s an optimization of the RRT algorithm. In simple terms, it creates a tree of paths by randomly sampling points and connecting them. As it grows, the algorithm continuously refines the path to find the most efficient, shortest route.

Unlike basic RRT, RRT* focuses on continuously improving the path to make sure it’s the best one possible. This means that your robot will navigate more efficiently, avoiding obstacles and finding the quickest route."

**[Scene 2: Implementing RRT* in FTC]**

HOST: "In FTC, RRT* can be used to dynamically plan paths in real time. Whether you're avoiding other robots or field elements, RRT* will constantly update the robot's path to ensure it stays on course, even when the environment changes unexpectedly."

**Sensors Script**

**[Introduction]**

HOST: "Let’s now take a look at the **sensors** we use in FTC. Sensors are critical for making our robots smart and responsive. They give our robots the ability to see, feel, and avoid obstacles, as well as track important game elements."

**[Scene 1: Color Sensors]**

HOST: "Color sensors are used to detect colors on the field, which is crucial for identifying alliance colors and game elements. By adjusting the sensor’s threshold, we can improve its accuracy in detecting the right colors, making it a valuable tool for tasks like aligning with a game piece or detecting objects."

**[Scene 2: Touch Sensors]**

HOST: "Touch sensors are simple but effective. They can detect physical contact, which makes them perfect for triggering actions when the robot comes into contact with something, like stopping when it hits a wall or a game element. They’re also great for safety purposes."

**[Scene 3: Distance Sensors]**

HOST: "Distance sensors, which use infrared or ultrasonic waves, help the robot detect the distance between itself and other objects. These sensors are perfect for obstacle avoidance and precise positioning. Whether you're aligning with a target or navigating around obstacles, distance sensors are a key part of making the robot move precisely."

**TeleOp Optimization Script**

**[Introduction]**

HOST: "Finally, let’s talk about **TeleOp optimization**. During a match, the driver has to control the robot in real-time, so it’s essential to make the controls as intuitive and efficient as possible."

**[Scene 1: Signals for Drivers]**

HOST: "One way we can help the driver is by using **signals**—these could be LED lights, on-screen messages, or even audible alerts that give the driver important feedback. For example, an LED light might blink when the robot successfully picks up a game element. This helps the driver focus on the next task, without having to visually check the robot every time."

**[Scene 2: Field-Centric Drive]**

HOST: "Another cool feature is **field-centric drive**. This makes the controls more intuitive by orienting them relative to the field, not the robot’s orientation. So, when the driver pushes the joystick forward, the robot always moves upfield, no matter which way it's facing. This is achieved using an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) that tracks the robot’s orientation and adjusts the controls accordingly."

These concepts are the foundation of building an efficient and accurate robot for any FTC match. Be sure to experiment with these ideas, test them out on your robot, and keep refining your design.
